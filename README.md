# Cellular_Automata_And_Infectious_Diseases
This repository that contains code which uses cellular automata to model the spread of infectious diseases based on the SIR and SIRS models. The main script is InfectiousDisease.py, which contains class definitions for running the simulations. All the other scripts are different scenarios. The figures display the results from some of the simulations.
